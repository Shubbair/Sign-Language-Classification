# Sign Language Recognition

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

sign language recognition of dataset used from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)

## Background

why this , to distroy the chain between normal and deaf people

## How is it used?

I train the model with (99.6%) and you can you used it with lifetime camera

## AI methods

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CNN      | convelutional neural network       |


## Challenges

my project depend on pixels of image and that may cause confuse the model between hand and other objects

## What next?

in the future it's will be in phones and in IOT systems
